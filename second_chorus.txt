Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me (die for me)
I had a really bad feeling you've been lying to me (lying to me)
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me (high with me)
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see (side I see)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (die, die, die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (lie, lie, lie)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (die, die, die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah (you lied, yeah)
