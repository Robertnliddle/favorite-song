It was love at first sight, felt like you were chosen
But that blood in your veins, yeah, I know it's frozen (it's so cold)
Got no patience no more (no)
Been waitin' too long (yeah)
You hid that shit away and I was the last one to know, bitch (ayy)
I heard you comin' in, I was lyin' there awake
Didn't know that it was you, got the gun right out the safe (damn)
Remember when you got my ass arrested (wow)
At least when I was in jail, I got some rest in
