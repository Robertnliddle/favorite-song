Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see (but you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (you'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (but you lied, you lied, you lied)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (you'd die, you'd die, you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (but you lied, you lied, you lied)
