It was a VIP, happened to be one of my best nights
9 am, I came from out the club, it was daylight (daylight)
Got a bad girl, I was treating her too nice (I was treating her too nice)
Caught you being vulnerable, that ain't what I need (that ain't what I need)
You just sold your soul, girl, quit crying (sold your soul)
From your passport, it looks like you lying (know you cold)
You broken down by your past, don't deny it (you know I know)
Your ex called, you was vulnerable, you flying, nah (flying)
Wasn't on the best of terms, girl, I was trying (I was trying on ya)
I did everything to reach out to you (I was reaching out)
Said you never had me caught up in no drama (no drama)
I done ran into my karma (I done ran)
