Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me (that you would die)
I had a really bad feeling you've been lying to me (you'd been lying)
We been on the low, but you been getting high with me (you was high)
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see (a different side)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (said you'd die, you said you'd die)
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (now you're lying)
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
